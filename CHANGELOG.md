# Change Log

## 4.0.1

## 4.0.0

- Added FastRender.onDataReady callback
- Added Extra Data API

## 3.3.1

- published as `communitypackages:fast-render`

## 3.3.0

- Fix for Meteor 1.9 (thanks @mrauhu)

## 3.2.0

- Flush buffered DDP writes for every message instead of batching them together, so that one failure doesn't cause them all to fail. There is a race condition between the `Accounts` package and `FastRender.init` in development mode. FastRender's buffered writes will fail if `Accounts` adds the `user` document to the collection after FR's checks, but before/during the batched buffered write. This change makes the buffered writes atomic and adds better error messages so we can tell specifically which write has failed.

## 3.0.8
